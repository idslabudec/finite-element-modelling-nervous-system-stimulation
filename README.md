# Finite Element Modelling for Biophysical Models of Nervous System Stimulation: Best Practices for Multiscale Adaptive Meshing - Simulation Files

Welcome to the **Finite Element Modelling for Biophysical Models of Nervous System Stimulation: Best Practices for Multiscale Adaptive Meshing** repository! This repository contains simulation files forreproducing the experiments presented in the paper "Finite Element Modelling for Biophysical Models of Nervous System Stimulation: Best Practices for Multiscale Adaptive Meshing".
The models included in this repository simulate the effects of electrical stimulation on:
- **Thigh Muscle:** Focusing on analysing double derivative errors and their effects on a Hodgkin-Huxley axon model.
- **Cortical Region:** Focusing on analysing double derivative errors produced by material changes and Multiscaling meshes.
